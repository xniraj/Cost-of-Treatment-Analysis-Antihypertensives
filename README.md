# 💊 Pharmaceutical Pricing Analysis – Cost of Treatment Study

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the price variation of 11 antihypertensive drugs across four major therapeutic classes using Microsoft Excel. It aims to evaluate cost disparities among different brands and understand their potential impact on patient affordability — a concept central to **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** and **Cost of Treatment (COT)** analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess brand-wise cost variation in commonly used antihypertensive drugs.
- Calculate % price variation using Excel-based formulas.
- Create visual and tabular summaries for interpretation.
- Derive insights relevant to HTA and Market Access roles.
